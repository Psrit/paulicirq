This is a toolkit for developing quantum computing projects, which is based on [Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq) and [OpenFermion](https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion).

This toolkit contains implementations for some quantum algorithms like overlap test, and for some gates which may be used as building blocks in some quantum circuits.
